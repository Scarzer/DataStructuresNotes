# Introduction

## Course Objectives and Schedule
- What
- Why
- Where
- How

### What?
-Data Structures
    Specificiaton, design, implementation and uses of: Arrays, lists, queues, stacks, trees

*OOP and C++
   * C++ classes, container classes, Big Three!
   * All of this will be implemented in C++
   * C++ can be used to write fantastic GUIs 
   * C++ is one of the most mature of the languages

*Standard Template Library
    Templates, iterators
    ADTs in our DS course cut-down verion of STL

*Recursion, Searching and Sorting algorithms 
    Important techniques in many applications 

### Why?

*Data Structures(How to organize data)
    Algorithms(How to manipulate data) are the cores of todays computer programming

*The behavior of Abstract Data Types( ADTs) in our data structures cours is a cut down version of the STL

### Goals (Where)
   * We want to understand the data types inside out
   * We want to know where will we use what thing?

### Good Textbooks
   * Reference: C++ How to Program

### Assignments


### Phase of Software Development
   * Basic Design Strategy
       * Specifythe problem - I/O (Reading: Ch.1)
       * Design data structures and algorithms 
       * Implement in a languge such as C++
       * Test and Debug the problem (Reading Ch 1.3)
           * Divide and Conqure these motherfuckers!!!
    * Design Technique
       * Decomposing the Problem
        
    * Two Important Issues
       * Pre-Conditions and Post-Condtiions 
       * Running Time Analysis (How many operations are being run?)


## Pre Condtions and Post Conditions

    * Frequently a programmer must communicate precisely what a function accomplishes, without any indication of how the fucntion does it's work 
    

```cpp 

int *p;
int a[100];

p = a + 50 // p = &a[50];
```
