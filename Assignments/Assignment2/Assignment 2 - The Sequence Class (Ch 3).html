        <dd> DO NOT send your executable files.</dd>
        <dd> Only one submission per group. It doesn't matter which group member submits

      <ol>
        <li> <tt>sequence1.h:</tt> The header file for the sequence
          class.
          Actually, you don't have to write much of this file. Just start with
	  <a href="http://www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/%7Ewolberg/cs212/hw/hw2/sequence1.h">our version </a>and add your name and other
          information at the top. Also, decide on appropriate private member
          variables, an declare these in the sequence class definition at the
          bottom of the header file.
	  If some of your member functions are implemented as inline functions,
          then you may put those implementations in this file too.</li>
        <li> <tt>sequence1.cpp:</tt> The implementation file for this
          first sequence class. You will write all of this file, which will
          have the implementations of all the sequence's member functions.</li>

    <h3> The sequence Class Using a Fixed-Sized Array<br>
      Discussion of the Assignment</h3>
    Many of the features of this class are similar to the <b>bag</b>
    class
    from Section 3.1, so start by thoroughly reading Section 3.1 and pay
    attention to new features such as <i>static constant members</i>
    and
    the use of a <i>typedef</i>. The sequence class itself is discussed
    in
    Section 3.2 of the class text. Notice how the sequence differs from
    a
    bag (see page 119). The interactive test program <tt><a href="http://www-cs.engr.ccny.cuny.edu/%7Ewolberg/cs212/hw/hw2/sequence_exam.cpp">sequence_exam.cpp</a></tt>&nbsp; is
    discussed in Section 3.3 of the class text.
    <p>Start by declaring the sequence's private member variables in
      sequence.h. Then write the invariant of your ADT at the top of
      sequence1.cpp. The invariant describes precisely how all of your
      private member variables are used. All of the member functions
      (except for the constructor) may count on the invariant being true when
      the member function is activated. And all of the member functions are
      responsible for ensuring that the invariant is true when the function returns. </p>
    <p>As always, do your work in small pieces. For example, my first
      version of the sequence had only a constructor, start, insert, advance,
      and current. My other member functions started out as stubs. </p>
    <p>Use the interactive test program and a debugger to track down errors
      in your implementation. If you have an error, <i>do not start making
        changes until you have identified the cause of the error.</i> </p>
    <p>The ability to initialize and use a static member constant within
        the class definition is a relatively new feature. If you have an older
        compiler that does not support static const members, then you may use
    </p>
    <p><i>enum {CAPACITY = 30};</i> </p>
    <p>instead of </p>
    <p><i>static const size_type CAPACITY = 30;</i> </p>
    <p>After this definition, the name bag::CAPACITY is defined to have the
	integer value 30. Although this is not the intended use of an
        enum definition, the result is the same as using a static member
        constant (see more discussions on page 99 in the textbook).<br>
